      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="./static/profile-jr.png" alt="Judith Rohatiner" />
      <p>
        Hello. My name is Judith Rohatiner. As a Full-stack Software Engineer I
        use cutting edge technologies to create responsive web and mobile
        applications that perform optimally across all devices and in all
        browsers. My experience encompasses agency environments, enterprise,
        healthcare, fintech, higher education and start-ups. I am also the Founder & CTO of
        <a href="https://CampDebuggIT.com">CampDebuggIT.com</a>
        </P>
      <p>
        <strong><a href="https://developers.google.com/womentechmakers/"> Women Techmakers
        Ambassadors</a></strong>
        has brought us together today, in cooperation with <strong>GDG Miami</strong>,
        for DevFest 2023! On a personal note, Iâ€™m married to Stuart. I have two grown daughters.
        In my spare time I bake pies, grow vegetables, renovate houses, sketch and 
        hike with my dog Gizmo.

      <h2>What is Accessibility</h2>
      <blockquote>
        Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the Web.
        More specifically, Web accessibility means that people with disabilities
        can <b>perceive, understand, navigate, and interact</b> with the Web,
        and that they can <b>contribute to the Web</b>.
      </blockquote>
      <h2>
        We are on a mission
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
        When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, people with
        disabilities can use them. However, currently many sites and tools are
        developed with accessibility barriers that make them difficult or
        impossible for some people to use.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Sub Categories We Will Discuss</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Web Performance</li>
        <li>Internationalization</li>
        <li>UI Design</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>Some Statistics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          26 percent (one in 4) of adults in the United States have some type of
          disability.
        </li>
        <li>2 in 5 adults age 65 years and older have a disability</li>
        <li>
          20 percent of people in the US (48 million people) report some degree
          of hearing loss, and 29 million of them could benefit from using
          hearing aids.
        </li>
        <li>
          2.3 percent of people in the US (7 million people) report having a
          visual disability, and 1 million people in the US are legally blind.
        </li>
        <li>
          16 percent of people in the US (39 million people) have difficulties
          with their physical functioning. 17.1 million people would find it
          very difficult or impossible to walk unassisted for a quarter mile.
        </li>
        <li>
          Roughly 8 million people in the US have an intellectual disability,
          including 425,000 children.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Types of disabilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Mobility and physical</li>
        <li>Cognitive and neurological</li>
        <li>Visual</li>
        <li>Hearing</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>The web is already accessible</h2>
      <p>
        For example, let's check out
        <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">
          The first website </a
        >. It's very easy to use with assistive technologies.
      </p>
      <h2>Why should developers should learn accessibility?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It's a worthwhile challenge!</li>
        <li>We're the ones who made it inaccessible. We should be the ones to fix it.</li>
        <li>Human Rights</li>
        <li>Legal Issues and Compliance (VPAT)</li>
        <li>Reach a much larger audience</li>
        <li>Your expertise will make you a specialist</li>
        <li>Your commitment will help save the world.</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>A NOTE about the Curb-Cut Effect</strong>
        <blockquote>
           in its essence, asserts that an investment in one
          group can cascade out and up and be a substantial investment in the
          broader well-being of a nation -- one whose policies and practices
          create an equitable economy, a healthy community of opportunity, and
          just society.

              <h2>Accessibility Standards</h2>
              <h3>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</h3>
              <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG</a>
              specifies three different
              <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#levels"
                >conformance levels</a
              >
              they are:
              <ul>
                <li>A (lowest)</li>
                <li>AA (mid range)</li>
                <li>and AAA (highest)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We'll discuss this more later when we look at VPAT reports</p>
              <blockquote>
                Level A sets a minimum level of accessibility and does not achieve broad
                accessibility for many situations. For this reason, UC recommends AA
                conformance for all Web-based information.
              </blockquote>

              <h3>WebAIM</h3>

                <a href="https://webaim.org/">WebAIM</a>
                provides a handy
                <a href="https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist">checklist</a> with
                their recommendations.
              </p>
              <p>WebAIM specifies that accessible websites should be:</p>

                <li>Operable</li>
