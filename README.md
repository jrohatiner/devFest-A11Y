## Installation

Just download or clone the repository and open index.html in your favorite browser!

## Exercises

All exercises should be clearly explained. Please don't hesitate to ask or open an issue if there is any confusion. Some of them are vague, like the semantic HTML section. There is no _right_ answer for these, just poke around the code and see if you can improve the experience for users with disabilities.
